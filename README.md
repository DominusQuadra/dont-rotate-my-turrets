# dont-rotate-my-turrets
Another mod for [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry).
This one removes the ability to rotate turrets that was added in build 152. Works only with vanilla turrets since I couldn't figure out how to access other mods' files.
Works with multiplayer, though from other players' perspectives the turrets that you place always face to the east.
Probably not gonna update this.
